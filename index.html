                    <p>Through a combination of formal training and curiosity, I am a database designer and developer, a data analyst, a historian of power and communication, and a photographer.</p>

                    <p>I blog on <cite><a href="http://packets.jeanbauer.com" target="_blank">Packets: Musings on Information Exchange</a></cite> and tweet as <a href="http://twitter.com/jean_bauer" target="_blank">@jean_bauer</a>.</p>

            	<h1>Portfolio</h1>
            	<h2>Tools</h2>
                    <p>I am an open source developer with a special interest in relational databases and data visualization.  All my code can be found on my <a href="http://github.com/jabauer" target="_blank">github page</a>.  I am the lead developer on two open source tools:</p>

                    <p><a href="http://projectquincy.org" target="_blank">Project Quincy</a> is a Django application with a MySQL database that uses information about people, places, and organizations to trace how social networks and institutions develop over time and through space. It is named in honor of John Quincy Adams (1767-1848).</p>

                    <p><a href="/davila.html">DAVILA</a> is a relational database schema visualization and annotation tool. It is written in <a href="http://processing.org" target="_blank">Processing</a> using the <a href="http://toxiclibs.org" target="_blank">toxiclibs</a> physics library.  I built DAVILA to help database developers create visually appealing and semantically rich interactive diagrams to document their database designs, and to support shared understanding with both programmers and non-programming data analysts.</p>

                <h2>Research and Design</h2>
                    <p>My research interests range from data structures to 18th-century diplomacy to information design. I attack these questions by combining theoretical investigation and research with data modeling, application development, and data visualization. As Associate and then Research Director of the <a href="http://cdh.princeton.edu" target="_blank">Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton</a> I worked on every project we accepted from 2014-2018.  Below are some of my favorite projects. For a full list see the <a href="http://cdh.princeton.edu/projects" target="_blank">CDH Project Page</a> and my <a href="bio">CV</a>.</p>

                    <p>is an open access repository and analysis platform for the study of American diplomats, consuls, and special agents from 1775-1825. The EAFSD recreates the social, commercial, and epistolary networks of the U.S. Foreign Service in the Age of Sail by connecting people, places, and organizations through the transfer of information by letters or permanent overseas assignments. The EAFSD is built on Project Quincy, and has been live since 2010.</p>

I designed the database for Derrida's Margins, and developed a structure which parallels Derrida's own theories of reading and the interrelationship of all text.</p>

                    <p>is a collaboration with James Egan, Professor of English at Brown University, to map the spatial and genre distribution of printing in the Americas before 1800 using the rare book catalog records of the John Hay and John Carter Brown Special Collections Libraries. In the process, the project reads rare book catalogs as texts to be studied and modeled. The project integrates Spanish, French, Dutch, and English colonial printing with American Indian texts from North and South America and provides a visual portal of rare books held at Brown University.</p>

                <h2>Courses</h2>

                    <p>I have  designed three hands-on courses and taught two courses in Digital Humanities and Data Analysis.</p>

                    <p><b>Weird Data.</b> Spring 2019, Princeton University, FRS 154. I designed this course for the Center for Statistics and Machine Learning to introduce Princeton freshmen to the practical and theoretical challenges of finding, gathering, analyzing, and publishing data.</p>

                    <p><b>Data Visualization Lab for Visualizations in the Humanities: From the Cabinet of Curiosities to the Geoparser.</b> Fall 2013, Brown University, AMST 2661. I created and taught a weekly, hands-on, 1-hour Data Visualization Lab that was designed to support a graduate class on the theory of visualization, and to prepare students to complete a digital humanities project by the end of the
                    semester. (Faculty Instructors Steven Lubar, American Studies, and Massimo Riva, Italian Studies) <a href="http://amst2661.wordpress.com/syllabus/" target="_blank">http://amst2661.wordpress.com/syllabus/</a></p>

                    <p><b>From Vellum to Very Large Databases: Historical
                    Sources Past, Present, and Future.</b>  Spring 2010, University of Virginia, HIST 4501. The course focused on the changing nature of historical sources and the implications of these changes for the practice of academic history.

                <h2>Cohorts</h2>
                    <p>I designed and led two year-long instructional cohorts through the Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton. No prior technical experience was required for either cohort.</p>

                    <p><b>Social Network Analysis Cohort</b>, 2016-2017. Taught humanities graduate students how to formulate research questions amenable to network analysis and then identify, gather, clean, analyze, and visualize social network data relevant to their research.</p>

                    <p><b>Database Cohort</b>, 2017-2018. Taught humanities and social science graduate students and lecturers how to model their data and research questions as a logical system, then implement the model in commandline SQL, and query their database to answer research questions. Worked with CDH development and design team to create common development environment in Vagrant with python3, MySQL, and Django.</p>

                <p><a href="documents/BauerResume2019_WebVersion.pdf" target="_blank">Professional Resume</a> | <a href="documents/BauerCV_WebVersion.pdf" target="_blank">Curriculum Vitae</a></p>
                <p>I have over 10 years of experience as a director, technologist, researcher, and consultant in digital humanities&#8212the application of computational tools and methods to traditional humanities disciplines such as literature, history, and the arts.  I have led successful design, migration, visualization, and software projects involving heterogeneous data sources, and team members with a diversity of skills and expertise.</p>

                <p>My love of great stories and unusual solutions led me to the early days of American diplomacy, when Benjamin Franklin and John Quincy Adams were writing a nation into existence from across the ocean. I developed <a href="http://projectquincy.org" target="_blank">Project Quincy</a> and <em><a href="http://eafsd.org" target="_blank">The Early American Foreign Service Database</a></em> to enable and showcase the work of my dissertation “<a href="https://doi.org/10.18130/V3DZ8Q" target="_blank">Republicans of Letters: The Early American Foreign Service as Information Network, 1775-1825</a>.”</p>

                <p>While a graduate student at the University of Virginia, I transcribed, translated, and decrypted letters for <em><a href="https://founders.archives.gov/" target="_blank">The Papers of James Madison</a></em>, and I was a founding employee and Design Researcher for Documents Compass, a digital consulting organization for documentary editors and a service provider of the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities. While at Documents Compass I developed data structures and workflow migrations to create <em><a href="https://pfe.rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/" target="_blank">The People of the Founding Era</a></em>. Through these projects I saw firsthand the need for inclusive technical documentation, which brought me to information design and creating DAVILA.</p>

                <p>I joined the Brown University Library as their first Digital Humanities Librarian in 2011. In my time at Brown I collaborated with Jim Egan to build the <em><a href="http://cds.library.brown.edu/projects/mapping-genres" target="_blank">Mapping Colonial Americas Publishing Project</a></em>, an interactive exploration of the Brown Library catalog which brought together my interest in data visualization and the history of the book with Jim's background in Colonial American literature.</p>

                <p>While at Brown, I became the first Executive Secretary for <b>centerNet</b>, the international professional organization for directors of digital humanities centers. During my three years at <b>centerNet</b> (2012-2015), I worked with Co-Directors Kay Walter and Neil Fraistat in the successful transition of centerNet to a formal, dues-paying Constituent Organization of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations. I co-authored membership guidelines and new organizational by-laws and coordinated annual membership drives with Oxford University Press. I wrote the annual reports and served as Chair of the first Nominating Committee for the International Executive Steering Committee. </p>

                <p>I became the first Associate Director of the <a href="http://cdh.princeton.edu" target="_blank">Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton</a> (CDH) in September 2014, and became Research Director in 2018. In my time at Princeton I built the CDH into a robust center with a wide-ranging project portfolio and recognized leaders in research project management. I created the Development and Design Team within the CDH to envision and ship stable, extensible, compelling, documented, and intuitive full-stack software solutions to thorny research questions involving messy data.</p>

                <p>In 2019 <a href="http://packets.jeanbauer.com/2019/01/22/ursula-k-le-guin-marie-kondo-and-moving-on/" target="_blank">I left the academy</a> to become an independent consultant and writer.</p>

                <p>I have been photographing my world since I received my first SLR at age 13, looking for unusual angles and perspectives on cityscapes, people, mountains, and anything else I see. The look of this website has been designed around my <a href="https://jabauer.dphoto.com/album/ymm5mt/photo/41624181" target="_blank">photograph of the pigments in Frida Kahlo’s studio in Mexico City</a>.</p>
